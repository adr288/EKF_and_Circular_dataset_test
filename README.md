# Circular Localization Simulation

To run the dataset test, download and sample the [UTIAS Multi-Robot](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/datasets/mrclam/index.html#Download) dataset and add this repos's matlab script to save the datasets. (sampling rate is the default 0.02 sec). If choosing a different sampling value, change that in the .cofig file as well.

Then run the `sim_dataset.py` by choosing the dataset and robots in the for loops.
